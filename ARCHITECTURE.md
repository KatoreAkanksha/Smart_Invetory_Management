# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and design decisions for the Financial Dashboard application.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI for accessible components
- React Query for data fetching
- React Router for routing

## Architecture Principles

1. **Component-Based Architecture**

   - Components are organized by feature and reusability
   - Follows the Atomic Design methodology
   - Uses composition over inheritance

2. **State Management**

   - Context API for global state
   - React Query for server state
   - Local state for component-specific data

3. **Error Handling**

   - Global error boundary
   - Component-level error boundaries
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Performance**

   - Code splitting with React.lazy
   - Memoization with React.memo and useMemo
   - Optimized re-renders
   - Bundle size optimization

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for utilities and hooks
   - Integration tests for components
   - E2E tests for critical flows

## Project Structure

├── components/     # UI components
├── config/         # Configuration
├── contexts/       # React contexts
├── hooks/          # Custom hooks

```

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**

   - One component per file
   - Clear file naming conventions
   - Proper TypeScript types

2. **Performance**

   - Lazy loading for routes
   - Memoization where appropriate
   - Optimized re-renders

3. **Security**

   - Input validation
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection
   - Secure API calls

4. **Accessibility**
   - ARIA attributes
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support

## Future Improvements

1. **Scalability**

   - Micro-frontend architecture
   - Service workers for offline support
   - Progressive Web App features

2. **Performance**

   - Server-side rendering
   - Static site generation
   - Image optimization

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Better documentation
   - More automated tests
   - Improved error tracking
